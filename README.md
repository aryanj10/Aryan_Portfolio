## [Project 1: News Summarization Telegram Bot](https://github.com/aryanj10/News-Summarization-Telegram-Bot) 
* Developed a system to summarize news articles by utilizing techniques such as sentence embedding using the sentence transformer model.
* Calculated content relevance score, sentence novelty score, and sentence position score to determine the importance of each sentence within the article. Applied a weighted average of these scores to rank and prioritize sentences, ensuring that the most informative and relevant ones are included in the summary.
* Created a Telegram bot to provide users with access to the summarization algorithm, enabling them to conveniently obtain news article summaries.

## [Project 2: Employee Compensation Estimator](https://github.com/aryanj10/Employee-Compensation-Regression) 
* Developed a comprehensive employee compensation estimation system by utilizing factors such as salaries, overtime, job family, health/dental insurance and other employee data.
* Applied various pre-processing techniques to clean and prepare the data for analysis
* Utilized XGBoost, to build a robust and accurate predictive model for estimating total compensation.

## [Project 3: Medical Insurance Cost Estimator](https://github.com/aryanj10/Medical-Insurance-Cost-Regression)
* Developed a medical insurance cost estimation system by utilizing factors such as age, sex, bmi, smoking and other data.
* Applied various pre-processing techniques to clean and prepare the data for analysis
* Utilized random forest, to build a robust and accurate predictive model for estimating cost.

## [Project 4: Forest Cover Type Classifier](https://github.com/aryanj10/Forest-Cover-Type-Classification)
* Developed a machine learning model to predict the forest cover type by utilizing factors such as elevation, aspect, soil type, and other relevant attributes of the forest.
* Applied various pre-processing techniques to clean and prepare the data for analysis
* Utilized Random Forest Classifier, to build a robust and accurate classifier model

## [Project 5: Forecasting NBA Rookies' Career Longevity](https://github.com/aryanj10/NBA-Longevity-Classification)
* Developed a machine learning model to predict whether a player's career will flourish or not by utilizing factors such as games played, count of games played, and other game statistics.
* Applied various pre-processing techniques to clean and prepare the data for analysis
* Utilized LightGBM, to build a robust and accurate classifier model
